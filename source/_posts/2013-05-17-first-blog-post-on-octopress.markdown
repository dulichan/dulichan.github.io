So the new progress is writing posts on Octopress and getting parsed by Jekyll. C'mon I don't have to waste my time with database servers, oh and the nightmare of Wordpress. I was also getting tired of maintaining my tumblr blogs. I sometimes by accident posts technical blog posts to my instagram tumblr. It was a true nightmare. I am checking if Octopress will relieve me off from it and allow me to write on my Mac - on TextMate :D.

## Jaggery and writing server side javascript

Currently I am writing jaggery code to build our new product. I will talk about it in the upcoming months and it's gonna be huge in the open-source community.
