I read 'The Alchemist' about a year back and found it to be a very good book. It thought me many lessons as well. This post is not gonna be a review about the book but an understand about the important life lessons taught to us by Paulo Coelho via 'The Alchemist'.

# World's greatest lie

When the boy met the King in the market, the King gave him life lesson -

> It's this: that at a certain point in our lives, we lose control of what's happening to us, and our lives become controlled by fate. That's the world's greatest lie.

Our lives were never under fate. It was always under us. We need to understand that we have the power to change our lives to the ideal life we want it to be. If you want to be billionaire, aim to be a billionaire - Dream like a billionaire and work like a billionaire. And one day you'll most certain be a billionaire.

# Offer something you have

When the king offered the boy information about the treasure - he asked for 1/10 of the boy's sheep. The boy thought he could promise 1/10th of the treasure (Just like the Gypsy). The King said 
> If you start out by promising what you don't even have yet, you'll lose your desire to work toward getting it.

When you are dealing with someone, don't try to trade promises. You'll have to give more than words and promises to get people to accept trades. From the other side, if you were ever asked of something promising to give you something back for it later, don't accept such a deal.

# Destiny

I am a big beliver of Destiny. You heard me right - A beliver of destiny. Rather than a destiny handed over to us by someone - I believe in a destiny I made for myself. When you have a destiny in life - you have a destination. When you get there you'll have another destiny. Destiny bring faith to ourselves - a faith that we can get there.

> To realize one's destiny is a person's only real obligation.

# Beginner's Luck
When good stuff happens when you start working on your destiny - it's because of Beginner's luck -

> It's called the principle of favorability. When you > play cards the first time, you are almost sure to win. Beginner's luck.

Call it God, Nature - there is a force that wants us to realize our destiny. Destiny favors us when we start off since we need motivation to keep interest. But after the start comes the hardships. No man has ever achieved success without failure. If not for faliure all men would be successful.

# Never stop dreaming
> Never stop dreaming

I guess the quote alone is enough for this.
