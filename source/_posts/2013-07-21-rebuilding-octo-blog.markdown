For the past few weeks my life has been going in pretty good turn of events. I am developing a small project management tool to manage personal projects. It will help me organize my hobby projects and motivate me to work on them throughout the week. 

Without the right motivation it would be impossible for me to do any work at all since I am working on the Enterprise Store full time at Work. It's gonna be an awesome product - I'll be blogging about it in the up coming weeks. 

The Octopress blog was giving me trouble since I have done the deployment in a wrong direction. I have deployed it according to the pages way as well as the profile way. Afterwards I deleted the repo and tried a clean start - then only I found out about this. Octopress is a pretty neat framework. I want to write couple of themes for it - but for now I am using a theme called **[DarkStripes](https://github.com/amelandri/darkstripes)**

Also for the poor souls who use TextMate (like me) you can use the below gist to make the hidden files appear for you for theme customization
