I have been a big fan of productivity and how to be more productive. I have been using many providers for my todo- lists and notetakers but I arrived at an important conclusion this week. 

> It’s not the tool that’s important. It’s the mindset


## Current setup
I am using two tools to manage my work and life. 

* Evernote - Personal organizer
* Remember the Milk - Task organizer

### Evernote
Evernote happens to be my place where I dump almost everything that happens. I have organized it to many notebooks but I mainly use a single Notebook approach and later on change notebook when I am reviewing Evernote. I have been using Evernote since 2010 (or maybe 2009) and I am very happy with the experience of it.

I also have to say that - I deleted many notebooks and notes before since the clutter was getting hectic. I had a personality trait where everything needs to be very clean, simple and decluttered. I didn’t particularly like this trait since the outer world can easily affect me.

To conquer this ‘problem’ what I did was to build a clear attitude in mind. Now even if everything is pretty hectic and blizzarding through I feel calm. Evernote contains is a very good personal organizer but overally any tool requires careful usage. 

I weekly review Evernote to scan my thoughts and figure out what going on in life. Since sometimes we tend to pilot through life without really knowing whats going on. Also I keep a Bucket-list in Evernote- I love to cross of stuff from this bucket list as it is a way to enjoy life more.

### Remember-the-milk
I started using RTM few days back and I understand why it’s an awesome tool. About 1 year back I used it but I was annoyed with the email notifications and not having buttons to complete tasks. But what do you know - after one year I have completely fallen in love with it. I have come to love shortcuts than buttons. Also the simple approach to task handling is something I was dying for. 

I have tried many orthodoxic pracitces in task management but non have ever really worked out. I either burn out of too many tasks or I feel sad not completely finishing everything off the list.

I have tried using a Shreadsheet approach as well but it requires lot of management -specially clean up of completed tasks. So that was out of the equation. I also tried a solution based on Dropbox of having a file for each day but that was also hectic since recursive tasks were not available. 

RTM requires you to skimp through the help document since you need to know the shortcuts - but I don’t mind that as I can achieve productivity clearly now.

## MindSet 
I also uncovered an important step where the mindset is the most important aspect when we are talking about personal management. Cause you need to really have a good idea of what’s going on. For that you need to train your mind everyday.

I started out a daily meditation program sometime back and it’s very important aspect of my life that helps me to understand the inner peace in me.
