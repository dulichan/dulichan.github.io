Today I learned one of the most important theories of life. It's about addiction. I learned it while I was reading Initial Drift 170 manga chapter - C'mon there are many more chapters left for me to finish it up. I have always had the addictive personality. If I find something interesting I'll get addicted to it and then I will living in it till I get bored. The good thing about this is that I can really learn, gain and build with that level of addictive concentration. Bad thing is that I might get addicted to the bad things ya know. Manga is ok but c'mon there are tons of bad stuff out there.

If I can tame the personality and use it for an advantage then I can really improve myself. So let's try it off. Also I am working on my constant improvement approach to life.
