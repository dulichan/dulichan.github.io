I have fallen in love with being a tinker. I build stuff from the available things out there. I bought a raspberry pi sometimes ago but I couldn't get wifi to it not having the update. I couldn't update it with Ethernet connection since I didn't have a wired connection to downstairs of my house (Where I have my TV). But this week I got a connection to downstairs for my TV box. I used that cable for network connection for my rpie and it was up and running.

### Configuring wifi on Rpie
This was the biggest challenge that I still have to work on. There is some error in wpa-config that comes in Weezy. Maybe I haven't configured the wifi properly.

### Media center
I got the Raspbmc['http://www.raspbmc.com'] installed on the Rpie and now I can Air Play videos to it. But please be aware that you can't Air Play mirror to the Raspbmc. So I guess it's still not a fully fledged Air Play unit that will replace AppleTV.
