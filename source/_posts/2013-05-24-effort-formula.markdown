Most of the time we usually think that effort will actually be equal to the output gain by a task. But that is not the truth in realty. What matters most is not the amount of effort one puts to a task but the task itself and how it will actually affect the ultimate goal of a person. Why do people get so distracted in the task that they forget the ultimate goal that they have in mind? 


### Ultimate goal

The reason they forget the ultimate goal is because they are human. Human's don't really put much effort into ultimate goals and future plans. They get distracted in the task - too much excitement so to speak. But the problem with all of that excitement is that it doesn't create sustainable motivation. 

### Experiment 

I am going to experiment this phenomena on myself. I am going to be driven by ultimate goals rather than tasks for the next 30 days. Today is the 24th of May - I am going to finish off this experiment on June 24th. After the experiment I can conclude that the effort formula is different. 

I will also be writing weekly reports in regards to this experiment of Ultimate goal driven experience to be accountable of my actions as well.
