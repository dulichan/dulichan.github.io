Every week I go for a run around the Diyawanna jogging track to clear my mind from the noise of life. It allows me to calm down and understand important things in life. There is a spot in the jogging track that is open to the Diyawanna lake where I sit down every week and decide what's going to happen the coming week. 

I urge everyone to take a walk at least once a week to understand life. Since most of the time we are overshadowed by our daily life. It tires us off and eventually kills us. Better make life than living.
