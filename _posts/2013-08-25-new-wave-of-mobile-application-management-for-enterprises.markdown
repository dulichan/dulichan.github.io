Enterprise Mobility is a serious concern for medium and large scale organizations in the present day. A lot of corporates are getting into the Enterprise Mobility era where employees are empowered through Mobile Devices. And there is also BYOD - Bring your Own Device. 
 
But there is also another concern - are these tools really delivering value to Enterprises? Short answer - Yes. But (there is a catch here) you'll have to find a solution that is properly tailored to you. 

## Why do corporates want to play around with Mobile Devices? 
>> Corporates are interested in increasing the productivity of business users. To allow this - they have been building in-house applications, integrating CRMs, ERPs for decades. Mobile Devices are the closet device to business users and it makes sense to utilize mobile devices for corporate use.  
## Use of Enterprise Mobile Platform
To increase the productivity of business users - corporate will have to allow mobile devices to access corporate resources such as -
* Email
* Content
* Internal Systems

There is also two types of mobile devices in corporate-
* Personal
* Corporate own

(In some cases it might only be Corporate own if the organization is not BYOD supportive)

The IT has to manage the devices in order to securely provision enterprise resources. With the management of devices also comes the policy and permission requirements. A usecase would be - Recent Sales data will only be available to senior executives. Also if the user losses his mobile device or leaves the organization - IT should be capable of wiping the enterprise resources from the mobile and un-provision the device (not allowing future corporate resource access). All these are requirements for Mobile Device Management Solution.

## Applications
Since Mobile devices require platform specific applications to be developed in order to access internal systems and APIs - the applications have to be safely provisioned as well. An Enterprise Mobile Store will come to play here and allow secure provisioning of the applications allowed to the user. 

## Conclusion 
We can see that Enterprise Mobility has many depths and areas of discussion necessary but it's still in it's infant stage. Also Enterprise Mobility evolves each time OS vendor gives an update (iOS7 is a classic example). The corporate will find many use cases where Enterprise Mobility will empower the business users of the organization.
