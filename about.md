I self describe myself as the continous improver who believes in changing the world. Talk to me on startup ideas, JavaScript, Internet of Things. I also love to travel the world and experience different cultures. 

I also do beer reviews on [Drinking Beer](http://drinkingbeer.tumblr.com/post/134106577460/oh-stella-one-of-a-kind-belgium-beer-thats-a).
